# Conclusion

Well I hope the mystery of `async`/`await` is now gone. If are now inspired to write your own *Executor* or *Runtime* just feel free to do so. With those basic concepts you also could extend the functionality of the `Brain` to support more advanced features also often required in async processing.

**Thanks for reading this small book - happy async coding ...**
