# Introduction

One of the main promises of asynchronous, parallel processing is that it can increase overal performance of your program. Although this does not apply to any generic situation, most of us would like to try out whether this could give the desired boost to your specific challenge. However, designing and writing a program ready to benefit from asynchronous execution is often challenging and sometimes requires knowledge of how the underlying bits and pieces fit together.
