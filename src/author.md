I started learning Rust the programming language in 2019. I was implementing a C++ bare metal kernel / OS on my Raspberry Pi back then and ran often into some memory issues that where hard to track down due to the lack of proper debugging tools in the bare metal environment. A colleague of mine introduced Rust to me with it's promises on concise code and memory safety, a clear ownership model and the compile time checks that make it hard to run into data races and memory issues. So I gave it a try and never regret it!

In my job I'm using several programming languages like ABAP, C/C++, Java, Javascript/Typescript and Scala - however, Rust is my favorite though.
