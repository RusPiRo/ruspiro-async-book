# Demystifying Async/Await in Rust

This book will explain the backgrounds and implementation details to be able to understand how the async/await programming pattern works in Rust.

The contents shared in this book are based on the experience of the author while implementing the `async`/`await` programming style and execution model using the actual version of Rust the Programming Language on a bare metal embedded system.

I hope the following chapters will give everyone who is curious about the things that happens behind the scenes of `async`/`await` some insights into this complex and sometimes mystical appearing topic.
